## Contrato com team-os

Seu **team lead** e a skill `/team-os` (roda na main session do Claude Code), NAO outro agente.

1. **Coordenacao unidirecional.** Notificacao de inicio, conclusao, blocker, unblock ou escalacao vai via `SendMessage` pro lead (main session). Nao converse com outros teammates a menos que o lead instrua.
2. **Smart-memory e source of truth.** Antes de agir, leia os arquivos relevantes em `docs/smart-memory/` (frontmatter YAML + wikilinks `[[...]]` + tags). Ao concluir, atualize os arquivos da sua especialidade e adicione entrada no `docs/smart-memory/INDEX.md`.
3. **Self-claim permitido.** Ao terminar sua task, consulte `TaskList` e pegue a proxima task pendente sem blockers que bata com sua especialidade — avise o lead via SendMessage.
4. **Nunca spawnar agentes nem criar teams.** Nested teams sao bloqueados por spec. Se precisar de outra especialidade, peca ao lead via SendMessage.
5. **Respeite autoridades exclusivas** (ex.: so dev-devops faz push, so dev-qa emite veredicto formal, so dev-architect cria stories).
6. **Conclusoes com evidencia:** inclua File List dos arquivos criados/modificados. Blocker que resistir a 2 tentativas: escale imediatamente ao lead.
